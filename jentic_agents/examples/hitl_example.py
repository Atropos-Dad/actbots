"""
Example demonstrating human-in-the-loop agent interaction using inbox, outbox, and intervention hub.

This example shows how the three communication abstractions work together:
- BaseInbox: Receives goals/tasks from users
- BaseOutbox: Sends progress updates and results back to users  
- BaseInterventionHub: Handles mid-execution requests for human assistance

Run with: python -m jentic_agents.examples.hitl_example
