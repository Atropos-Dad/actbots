You are about to call the tool **{tool_id}**.
{tool_schema}
{memory_enum}

Current goal: {goal}
Current step: {step}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If you have all the information needed to fill the required parameters with REAL values, provide a JSON object with those parameters.
2. If you are missing critical information (like channel IDs, user IDs, specific targets, etc.) that you cannot reasonably infer from the goal or available memory, respond with:
   NEED_HUMAN_INPUT: [list the specific parameters you need help with]

IMPORTANT RULES FOR PARAMETERS:
- Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
- For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
- **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need
- Only use ${{memory.<key>}} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
- DO NOT guess or make up IDs, tokens, or other critical identifiers
- DO NOT use placeholder text like "provide_channel_id" or "enter your token here"

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- If you have all needed info: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers
- If you need human input: Return "NEED_HUMAN_INPUT: parameter1, parameter2, ..." 

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.
