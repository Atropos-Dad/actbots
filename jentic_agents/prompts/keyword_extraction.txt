    "Generate a concise search query using 5-7 capability-focused keywords that describe the required functionality for this step.",
    "Include EXACTLY ONE provider keyword (e.g., 'github', 'discord', 'trello') based on the platform mentioned in the context, or omit provider entirely if platform is unclear.",
    "Never combine multiple platforms or APIs in a single query - focus on one provider at a time.",
    "Do not include tool names unless explicitly specified in the task.",
    "Do not include extra explanation or formatting, just the search query string.",
    "Base your keywords strictly on the current step, not the overall goal or future steps.",
    "Focus on action-oriented keywords that describe what needs to be done (create, update, fetch, send, etc.)."
